Problem a (PA7a.java)

Write a program that reads a stream of integers from a file and stores them in
an array. The array is then analyzed to compute the average of all the values
in the array and finally all of the values that are above the average should be
printed out to the screen. Specifically, you must write three methods: main(),
readIntoArray(), and printAboveAverage().

main() gets the path to the input file from the user and attempts to open the
file, outputting an error if the file cannot be opened. readIntoArray() is then
called to read values from the file and store them in the array. It must be
passed two arguments: a scanner opened on the file, and the array. You should
only store a maximum of 100 values from the input file, and so can size your
array appropriately. Note, however, that there might be fewer than 100 values
in the file. This method must return how many integers, up to 100, were read
into the array.

Finally, printAboveAverage() should be called to read through the array, compute
the average, and then print out all values in the array that are above the
average. In particular, for each value above the average it should print the
index in the array, as well as the value itself. printAboveAverage() should take
two arguments: the array and the actual number of values in the array. Note that
this second argument is not the total number of elements that the array can hold,
but is instead the number of values read from the file. For example, the array
should be able to hold up to 100 values, but there might have only been 15 values
in the file.
